Preguntas y respuestas:
1. Is 192 ms a good or bad round trip time? The answer depends on what is normal round trip time for
that path. If the round trip time is usually 43 ms, this is a large round trip time.
What can you do about large round trip times? If the delay is incurred within your network
infrastructure, perhaps there is a reason. For example, a firewall with an exorbitant number of rules
can affect network response times. If the delay is incurred outside your network infrastructure (such
as along a path through the Internet), there is not much you can do.
In this same trace file we can also look at the time from the DNS request to the DNS response to
determine the DNS response time (302 ms), however Wireshark has as DNS response time field
(dns.time). --> Establecer un tiempo de respuesta.
